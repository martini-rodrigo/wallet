# Wallet App

## Overview

The Wallet Service is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot to manage digital wallets. It supports wallet creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries (including historical balance), and funds transfer between users. It includes idempotency control and Kafka-based audit logging.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements

- **Idempotency**: Supported via `Idempotency-Key` in headers
- **Kafka Logging**: All transactions are logged asynchronously to Kafka
- **Validation**: Inputs are validated using Jakarta Bean Validation
- **Scalability-ready**: Modular architecture and stateless operations
- **Observability-ready**: Logs key events; easy to plug into observability tools
- **Error Handling**:
  Although the system performs basic exception handling, not all errors are centralized or exposed. Some internal exceptions are intentionally not returned to the client to avoid leaking sensitive information. A centralized error handler (e.g., via @ControllerAdvice) is planned for future improvements, ensuring standardized and secure error responses across¬†the¬†system.

## üìå Design Choices

- **Spring Boot**: was chosen for rapid development, robustness, and integration with Kafka and validation frameworks.
- **Kafka**: is used for audit logging to decouple logging from business logic and allow future integration with data analytics.
- **Idempotency Control**: ensures safe retries of operations like deposits or transfers using a custom strategy at the service layer.
- **Docker Compose**: simplifies running the whole stack locally, including Kafka and Kafka UI.
- **One Wallet per User**: The system is designed so that each user can have only one wallet. This decision was made to simplify balance management, ensure transaction integrity, and improve traceability.
The current system architecture assumes a one-to-one relationship between User¬†and¬†Wallet.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-offs

Due to time constraints, the following compromises were made:

- **Security**: No authentication or authorization was implemented, assuming a trusted internal environment.
- **Architecture**: Although the intention was to follow SOLID principles, the full refactoring to adhere strictly to these principles was not completed due to¬†lack¬†of¬†time.
- **Tests**: Only basic tests included; more scenarios and edge cases could be covered.
- **Database**: Replace H2 with PostgreSQL or another production-grade DB.
